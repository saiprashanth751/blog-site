ðŸš€ Just launched "Medium Clone," a full-stack content publishing platform designed for seamless writing and reading experiences! This project showcases a modern monorepo architecture, delivering high performance and a delightful user interface.

Empowering creators, this platform features robust user authentication, intuitive blog post creation and editing, and dynamic content display. Readers can effortlessly browse and engage with articles, all powered by a highly optimized serverless backend.

**Key Features & Capabilities:**
*   **User Authentication:** Secure signup and signin with JWT for protected routes.
*   **Content Management:** Create, edit, and publish blog posts with rich text capabilities.
*   **Dynamic Content Display:** Browse a curated list of articles or dive deep into individual posts.
*   **Responsive Design:** A fluid user interface that adapts beautifully across devices.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Leverages Cloudflare Workers and Prisma Accelerate for lightning-fast API responses and data access.
*   **Shared Validation:** Centralized schema validation ensures data integrity across frontend and backend.

**Tech Stack:**
*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, React Router DOM, Axios, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Hono (web framework), Cloudflare Workers (serverless platform), Prisma (ORM), Prisma Accelerate (database proxy), Hono JWT, CORS
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (managed via Prisma)
*   **Shared Logic:** Zod (schema validation), TypeScript
*   **DevOps/Deployment:** Cloudflare Workers (for backend), Vite (for frontend)

**Data Flow:**
1.  The **Frontend** (React application) sends HTTP requests (e.g., for user authentication, creating/fetching posts) to the Backend API.
2.  The **Backend** (Hono application deployed on Cloudflare Workers) receives these requests.
3.  Hono routes process the requests, performing authentication (using Hono JWT) and input validation (using Zod schemas from the `common` package).
4.  For database operations, the Hono application interacts with **Prisma**, which in turn uses **Prisma Accelerate** to efficiently connect to the PostgreSQL database.
5.  The **PostgreSQL Database** stores user and blog post data.
6.  Responses are sent back from the Backend to the Frontend.

This architecture provides a clear separation of concerns, allows for shared code (via the `common` package), and leverages serverless functions for scalable and performant API delivery.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
*   npm or Yarn
*   A Cloudflare account (for deploying the backend worker)
*   A PostgreSQL database (e.g., Supabase, Neon, or a local instance)
*   A Prisma Accelerate API key (if not using a direct database connection)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd medium-clone
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for `common` package:**
    ```bash
    cd common
    npm install
    npm run build # To compile shared types and validation schemas
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies for `backend` package:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    *   **Configure Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
        *   `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL database connection string (e.g., from Prisma Accelerate).
        *   `JWTSECRET`: A strong, random secret key for JWT signing.
        *   Example `wrangler.toml` already contains placeholders for these. You might need to update `DATABASE_URL` and `JWTSECRET` in `backend/wrangler.toml` or use Cloudflare Workers secrets.

    ```toml
    # backend/wrangler.toml
    name = "backend"
    main = "src/index.ts"
    compatibility_date = "2025-01-22"

    [vars]
    DATABASE_URL="your_prisma_accelerate_database_url" # Replace with your actual URL
    JWTSECRET= "your_jwt_secret_key" # Replace with a strong secret
    ```

    *   **Run Prisma Migrations:**
        ```bash
        npx prisma migrate dev --name init_schema
        ```
        This will apply the database schema defined in `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`.

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies for `frontend` package:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```
    *   **Configure Backend URL:** Update `frontend/src/config.ts` with your backend API URL. If running locally, it will be `http://localhost:8787`. If deployed, use your Cloudflare Worker URL.

    ```typescript
    // frontend/src/config.ts
    export const BACKEND_URL = "http://localhost:8787" // Or your deployed Cloudflare Worker URL
    ```

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend (Cloudflare Worker):**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Hono API server, typically on `http://localhost:8787`.

2.  **Start the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the React development server, typically on `http://localhost:5173`.

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to access the application.

### Deployment

#### Deploying the Backend (Cloudflare Worker)

1.  Ensure you have `wrangler` installed and configured for your Cloudflare account.
2.  From the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```
    This will deploy your Hono application to Cloudflare Workers. After deployment, update `frontend/src/config.ts` with the deployed worker URL.

#### Deploying the Frontend

The frontend is a standard React application built with Vite. You can deploy it to any static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages).

1.  Build the frontend for production:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run build
    ```
    This will create a `dist` directory with the optimized production build.
2.  Upload the contents of the `dist` directory to your chosen static hosting provider.
